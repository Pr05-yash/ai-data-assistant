# AI Data Assistant - Heart Disease Prediction

This project is an AI assistant designed for heart disease prediction using the Heart Disease UCI dataset.

## Features
- Data exploration (missing values, data shape, correlation heatmap, histograms)
- Logistic Regression model for heart disease prediction
- GUI application built with Tkinter for real-time predictions
- User-friendly interface to input health parameters and get prediction instantly

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model training

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI dataset available on Kaggle:
